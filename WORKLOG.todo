      ☐ visual regression
    
    PHASE 2: MULTI-MEASURE SUPPORT
    ☐ Basic 3:
      ☐ with barlines (https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/Tutorial#step-7-barlines--run-)
      ☐ with ending barline
      ☐ with repeats
      ☐ With ties over barlines
      ☐ change of time signature
      ☐ change of key signature

    ☐ Multiple systems
      ☐ responsive resizing
      ☐ time signature at first bar of each system
      ☐ key signature at first bar of each system
      ☐ tempo changes mid-system
    

PHASE 3: User Create Flows
  Basics:
    ☐ User can initialize a document with a number of empty measures, designating time signature and key signature
  Note Addition:
    ☐ USER can add a mix of quarter-notes, quarter-note rests, and quarter-note chords to > 1 measures
    ☐ USER can Undo and Redo
    ☐ USER can select a range of measures for playback
    ☐ USER cannot add notes or rests to a measure that is full


Running Task List
SHOULD-DO ENHANCEMENTS:
  ✔ optional metronome click track with playback @done (05/09/2025, 18:10:28)
  ✔ active and inactive states for control buttons (play, selected score) @done (05/09/2025, 18:10:31)
  ☐ Change synth for sampler and implement instrument selection

BUGS: 
  ✔ Whole bar rests should be centered @done (11/09/2025, 19:20:41)
  ✔ Stem Directions are not being auto-determined unless beamed @done (11/09/2025, 14:52:28)
  ☐ 3 - Stem Directions are not being auto-determined by voice
  ✔ 1 - no metronome clicks on bar rest examples @done (17/09/2025, 14:42:00)
  ☐ 5 - advanced tuplets (see quintSext) all whacky engraving (beaming and brackets and text display of ratio)
  
TECH DEBT:
  ✔ semantic change of "Musical Event" to "Durational" (for semantics) @done (05/09/2025, 11:42:17)
  ☐ 2 - having clef changes as Note Context Members feels redundant --- clef change notes should be determined based on clef property of NoteContext types
  ☐ 3 - lazy load score to simulate db / async io and stress test no-data state of main rendering component (at time of writing, <App />)
  ☐ 5 - namespacing / splitting of utils (libs) in VF / Tone.js integrations
  ☐ 4 - typing of tuple and object type events (2nd arg) and callback (1st arg) in Tone.Part can be improved by pulling types from Tone.js
